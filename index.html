                I have been programming for a few years now, in which time my love of programming has grown in tandem with my understanding of it. 
                I am now fully determined to pursue a career making software and I believe I have a good foundation to begin from.<br><br>
                In the past year I have undertaken the following courses: Level 2, and subsequently Level 3 (A-Level equivalent) in Coding Standards; 
                Harvard’s CS50 Introduction to Computer Science and CS50 Introduction to Programming in Python; as well as a Level 3 course in Networking 
                and Cybersecurity. In the past few months I have also built a website (<a href="https://rcgardenclub.co.uk">see here</a>) for a local club, and updated it twice; I created a 
                website (<a href="https://bleepblue.github.io/driftwood/">here</a>) for a family member’s music project; and I have also built a JavaScript version of Tetris (<a id="tetris" href="tetris/tetris.html">here</a>) which I 
                have spent time recently adding features to and improving for my own amusement – all of which projects were valuable learning experiences. 
                I have experience writing code in C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, as well as using various web frameworks, SVG, RegEx, Git, and photo editors — and I am very keen to learn more languages and technologies when I can!<br><br>
                My main motivation in becoming a programmer is to have work which is intellectually stimulating — and programming is something which fully absorbs me.
                I also want to work in a field in which I can continually be learning and improving.<br><br>
                Although it is true that I studied humanities subjects at college and university, thinking in the very logical and abstract way 
                programming requires is something that comes naturally to me, and I think this can be seen in my aptitude for Maths at school, 
                in which I took my GCSE a year early and got an A*.
